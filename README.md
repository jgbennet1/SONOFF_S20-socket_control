# SONOFF_S20-socket_control
This project is built to control the SONOFF® S20 10A 2200W Wifi Wireless Remote Control Socket, available from Banggood 
(https://www.banggood.com/SONOFF-S20-10A-2200W-Wifi-Wireless-Remote-Control-Socket-Smart-Timer-Plug-Smart-Home-Power-Socket-p-1142285.html)  using the Amazon hardware and the Alexa app. It allows for voice control, as well as using the manual button on the device.

The code is based on the work of Aruna Tennakoon (https://github.com/kakopappa/arduino-esp8266-alexa-wemo-switch), with modifications to use with the SONOFF® S20. This mostly includes the use of the physical button on the device to toggle power to the socket, along with controlling the socket with the alexa application and Amazon hardware.

Additional instructions in the sketch file.
