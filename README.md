# SONOFF_S20-socket_control
The code is based on the work of Aruna Tennakoon (https://github.com/kakopappa/arduino-esp8266-alexa-wemo-switch), with modifications to use with the SONOFFÂ® S20. This mostly includes the use of the physical button on the device to toggle power to the socket, along with controlling the socket with the alexa application and Amazon hardware.
